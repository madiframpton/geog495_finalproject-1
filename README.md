# Seattle Fire Station

## Project Description 
For my **Geog495** final project, I build  a Seattle FireStation locator using Mapbox GL JS. The goal for this project is to help people who live in Seattle area get to know where the fire stations are and can use the application to find them. The main function of my application is the map, all faire stations will be marked with an fire department icon on the map. At the same time, there will be a list on the left hand side which show the address for each fire station. You can click on both fire station icons or the address on the list, they both can zoom into the map to the fire station you selected.There are 36 fire stations total in Seattle area. The data is from Seattle GeoData.
